# ABC Retail Store Accounting Project


This project simulates the accounting process for ABC Retail Store, where I book all necessary accounting entries for the 202X fiscal period. The following tasks were completed:

1. **T-Accounts**: Created individual T-accounts for key financial categories, including assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses.
2. **Journal Entries**: Recorded all transactions based on real-world business activities (sales, purchases, rent, etc.).
3. **Trial Balance**: Compiled a Trial Balance at the end of the accounting period to verify that total debits equal total credits.
4. **Financial Statements**: Generated income statement and balance sheet to showcase the store's financial health.
